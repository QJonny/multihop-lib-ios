 Init method for this class.
 
 Since you are not passing in a display name, it will default to:
 
 [UIDevice currentDevice].name]
 
 Since you are not passing a routing protocol, the default one will be Flooding
 
 Which returns a string similar to: @"Peter's iPhone".
 
 @param serviceType The type of service to advertise. This should be a short text string that describes the app's networking protocol, in the same format as a Bonjour service type:
 
 1. Must be 1–15 characters long.
 2. Can contain only ASCII lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
 
 This name should be easily distinguished from unrelated services. For example, a text chat app made by ABC company could use the service type abc-txtchat. For more details, read “Domain Naming Conventions”.
